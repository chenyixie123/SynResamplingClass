# Synthetic Resampling Techniques for Classification Modelling

### Introduction
This is a python script to conduct analysis on the impact of synthetic resampling techniques on the performance binary classification models. For more information please check out our publication.

### Installation
We strongly recommend using Anaconda 3 enviroments which can be downloaded in from their [website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). All requirements are given in ```requirements.txt```.

(base) C:\path-to-this-directory> conda activate synresample
(synresample) C:\path-to-this-directory> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For usage of the script please use help argument:
